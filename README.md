The Heores of Pymoli: Three Observable Trends

1. Males take up a significantly greater percentage share of the total players in the data than the other two gender groups. As a result, males have a much higher total purchase value but the lowest average total purchase per person, due to the larger size of individuals.
2. Interestingly, unlike in the case of the male demographic, the 20-24 year olds do not have the lowest average purchase per person even though they have the greatest number of players. The age group with the lowest average purchase per person is the 35-39  group, which also has a relatively lowpurchase count. This could imply that individuals in the 20-24 age group actually spend much more individually than individuals in the 35-39 age group. 
3.  Just looking at the most popular items table, there does not seem to be a correlation between brice and pruchase count of the item.
